        <h3 class="mt-3">Harley</h3>
        <p>As the headliner for my projects, Harley deserves to be introduced first.
          I found her online – it was love at first sight and pretty quick the rescue team from Animal Happyend moved
          her from the shelter in Hungary to me. That was in June 2021, Harley was only about 7 months old.
          Since, she has grown a lot and became the proud Malinois x German Sheperd max-widt she was always ment to be.
          She is the best companion someone can have, through thick and thin.
          When I need her to be calm, she is, and when it's time to thrive, she can become a true war machine. 🦊🧡

        <h3 class="mt-3">Andrea</h3>
        <p>Hi, I am Andrea, from Switzerland. I am a graphic designer, front-end developer, scuba diver and dog-mom of
          2.
          After my initial education I collected a few years of experience in design-agencies, before I went
          to teach diving all around South East Asia for almost 10 years!
          I never lost my roots for design and aesthetics, when I made the decision to return to
          Switzerland in 2020/21 for good, it was rather easy to jump back in this world again.
          To keep growing, I chose to become front-end developer and completed my education with the courses from <a

          .🧜🏻‍♀️💙</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Jax</h3>
        <p>
          Jax is a pure breed Czechoslovakian Wolfdog. I selected him from a kennel in Alessandria, Italy.
          He was born early October 2022 and is therefore the youngster in the pack.
          Surely, he is not as easy going as other dog breeds, but we knew and were prepared for that.
          A dog with approximatly 27% wolf content needs a lot of training, patience and love which
          he of course all gets plenty of.
          Currently he is still a baby and my goal for him is to become a
          compagnion
          as thriving as Harley, well-mannered and so, so beautiful like a real wolf that captivates and impresses. 🐺🩶
